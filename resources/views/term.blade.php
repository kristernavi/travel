    <b>Airline Tickets</b>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
    If your Philippines package includes international or domestic airline tickets , WOW Philippines Travel Agency acts as an agent only, and our consolidators' cancelation or amendment charges shall apply.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
    <b>If we amend you're booking</b>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
    It is unlikely that we will have to amend your Philippines package booking. However, occasionally changes may become necessary which we reserve the right to make at any time. Most of these changes are minor and we will advise you at the earliest possible date. Airline flight times and carriers set out in publicity material are subject to change, and all details given to you are for guidance only.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
    Confirmed dates will be as shown on your itinerary and airline tickets. Should a material change become necessary, we will inform you as soon as reasonably possible by email, or text message. You may decide whether or not to accept the change, however you must accept or reject the proposed change in writing via email within 72 hours of notification, otherwise we will assume that you have accepted the proposed change.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
    A material change is one made to your travel arrangements before departure, involving change of departure or arrival airport (other than between airports within the same city airport system) outward or return flights being re-scheduled by more than 12 hours, or by substitution of hotel or accommodations originally booked with one of a lower grade. If we alter the airline, aircraft type operating your flight or routing, this is not considered a material change and we will be under no obligation to notify you of such change in advance.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
    <b>IMPORTANT NOTICE:</b> We are not responsible for changes which arise as a result of events outside of our control, such as technical or maintenance problems with transportation, changes imposed by re-scheduling or cancelation of flights by an airline, or main charter company, war or threat of war, civil strife, industrial disputes, natural disasters, bad weather or terrorist activity.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
    <b>If we cancel you're booking</b>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
    We reserve the right in any circumstance to cancel your booking. However, in no case will we cancel your booking less than 30 days prior to departure, unless it is for reasons outside of our control or for non-receipt of payment by you. If we do cancel you're booking (other than for late or non-payment) we will offer you a full refund of all monies paid in respect of the booking.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
    <b>Our Liability</b>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
    Our obligations and those of our suppliers providing any service or facility involved in any part of your travel are to take reasonable skill and care to arrange for the provision of such services and facilities and, where we or our supplier is actually providing the service or facility, to provide them with reasonable skill and care. Compliance with any applicable regulatory requirements (such as, for example, those of the Civil Aviation Authority) will be proper performance of our, and our suppliers', obligations. You must show that reasonable skill and care has not been used, if you wish to make any claim against us.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
    <b>Documentation</b>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">

You must ascertain by consulting your own doctor, if necessary the specific precautions deemed prudent for the country or destination you intend to visit and to ensure that the appropriate medication, inoculations or other precautions are taken.

</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
    We are neither a carrier nor a provider of hotel accommodations. Each journey (whether undertaken or not) that you book by land, sea or air is governed by the conditions of the carrier undertaking to provide that carriage. Some of these conditions limit or exclude liability and are often the subject of international agreements. Copies of the applicable agreements are available for inspection at the offices of the carrier concerned.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
    It is your responsibility to re-confirm the onward or return sectors of any air journey with the carrier concerned or such carrier's duly authorized agents and according to such carrier's regulations.

</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
    Should you fail to secure such travel insurance coverage prior to your Philippines Travel, then you accept full responsibility for yourself and all of the members of your party, and indemnify WOW Philippines Travel Agency and our overseas travel agents and representatives (as applicable) for any and all costs that may arise, which would otherwise have been met, had such travel insurance been in force.
